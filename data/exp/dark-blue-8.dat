L: What? I’m sorry guys.	B-OO
T: If you’re like…you know how you’re kinda coming at it at an angle.	O
F: Yeah, maybe there’s a way to go around and come back.	B-A
T: Or or could you just, when you come (?) the thing. You know you’re, you’re coming this way right…	O
F: Huh, huh.	B-OO
T: …could you just put like one extra turn in here (?) your turn and go straight.	O
F: Probably, I don’t know	B-A
T: It feels like there’s (?)	O
F: I feel like yeah we only have like thirty minutes left to do stuff so.	B-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
F: I think if we  stay focused (?) you.	I-OO
L: Okay, so lets see it goes straight, it, so it goes wah  wah wah	B-DO
S: <humming>	B-OO
L: Okay Fiona.	I-OO
T: Are you best do it on the floor with just…	O
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: Yeah. Hey Sarah do you want to help?	I-OO
S: Okay.	I-OO
L: Okay why don’t you help Fiona with the, like creating the area.	I-OO
S: Which area?	I-OO
L: On the floor.	I-OO
S: Are we finishing our second one?	I-OO
L: No, first one, perfecting it.	I-OO
F: Yeah because we don’t, the first one’s inconsistent it's probably gonna make us feel worse about the second one then it might not do so well.	B-DO
S: But the second one never mind	B-OO
L: Can you guys make the area?	I-OO
F: What do you mean like make a…	I-OO
L: Like. Sort of set up like that (?) the program.	I-OO
F: Alright. The thing that’s like (?) the napkin, it’s like there and then it. I’ll make a thing that. alright.	I-OO
L: Okay, ready? Lets go play.	I-OO
F: I don’t know, wait…	I-OO
L: What?	I-OO
S: Okay that didn’t work.	B-NSTO
F: Sorry I need to er	B-OO
S: Ah…	I-OO
L: Okay lets, what’s going for…	I-OO
L: Straight. Okay I need to try that again, can you straighten it up?  This is our original one okay.	B-A
F: Yeah.	B-OO
S: Okay.	I-OO
T: I don’t understand what’s happened	O
L: What?	B-OO
T: (?) the turn. Is this number one?	O
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: Yeah.	I-OO
T: So (?) back to base now?	O
L: Yeah	B-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
T: (?) not back where he started.	O
F: I know it doesn’t	B-A
S: It's a large okay.	I-A
F: …it doesn’t need to be…	I-A
T: (?) base.	O
F: …the base is er the whole like square thing.	B-A
S: Yeah if we start from here it goes like this and then…	I-A
F: Did we make any changes?	B-OO
S: …yeah.	I-OO
L: Yeah one, I just want to see what it actually does on the real…	I-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
F: It's kind of difficult to tell with this one.	I-OO
S: Remember it starts from the back.	B-A
L: Yeah. Like so?	I-A
F: Yeah.	B-OO
S: Yeah.	I-OO
L: I don’t know what this (?)? Okay it needs to turn more on that section.	B-DO
F: Oh.	B-NSTO
S: It worked again.	I-NSTO
F: It randomly does it though because it hits this and that fabric is a little lumpy we shouldn’t rely on this.	B-A
L: Okay. I’m going to switch it can you clean that up?	B-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
L: Thank you.	I-OO
S: Okay I wanna see a bulldozer at work.	I-OO
S: We should make it turn the other way.	B-ATO
L: It just if it gets back to base you can change it.	B-A
F: I feel like we should redo it so it goes like this, this, this, this and this so we can have it start…	I-A
L: Wait, just let me. I just need to switch to (?).	B-OO
F: No.	I-OO
L: Okay	I-OO
F: Okay.	I-OO
L: Make it lower down a little.	B-A
F: I feel like, Lyn do you think that we could just kind of, it's not really starting from scratch but if we make it go instead of doing all that stuff, if it goes right angle, right angle, er right angle right angle and knocks this over and then it goes back, back and back.	I-A
L: Okay, yeah.	B-OO
F: I just feel like it would be easier to do that.	B-A
T: If you, you know how you guys get all the way over here?	O
F: Yeah.	B-OO
T: If you get, touch the wall you get a lot of points.	O
F: If you touch the wall?	B-A
T: Yeah if you actually end up touching the wall that’s a distance travel.	O
F: Oh cool.	B-OO
T: So that wall’s worth nine points if you end up here.	O
F: Oh, okay.	B-OO
S: Think we should get there?	I-OO
F: Maybe we should just try for the second one?	I-OO
T: Yeah.	O
F: The one, those two and touching the back.	B-A
T: Yeah.	O
F: Lyn, we’re thinking maybe we could just try for the second one instead of trying to figure out this one, seem it's kind of tough, that we could just focus on doing the second one since we get points for touching the back wall anyway.	B-A
L: We do?	B-OO
F: Yeah I think so, we get nine points if we touch the back wall.	I-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
F: So where are we with that? I think we have…lets test it with the second one?	I-OO
L: Yeah, okay you guys want to go and try it?	I-OO
S: Yeah.	I-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
F: Okay, where was it for the second one?	B-A
S: Umm…	B-OO
F: Here.	B-A
F: Okay, okay so it was like…alright.	I-A
F: Why is it…what…okay that, that, it was, that’s weird it didn’t go as far as it normally does.	B-NSTO
S: Okay. Okay so we want it to go further this way.	B-A
L: Okay so when it goes there it should be long, lets do it so it goes that way.	I-A
F: Alright Sarah lets do it again so that we can actually like, I, I just want to be able to see what’s going on too. Lyn was this the front of the, did this count in front of that…	B-OO
L: I didn’t make that one but I think so, I think Sarah made it.	I-OO
S: Wait, what do you want me to explain?	I-OO
F: So was this front line, was that this or the tyre? Did that represent the front or this thing	B-A
S: I think, I forget.	B-OO
LGS: Well on the test I last saw it, this was here.	O
F: Yeah well that was for another setting we had for it, but thanks.	B-A
L: Lets try it from there.	I-A
F: I think it was supposed to be, this one was supposed to be two back.	I-A
L: Yeah except it was over	I-A
F: And over	I-A
L: Three.	I-A
F: Three okay.	I-A
L: Okay.	B-OO
LGS: Well what are you fixing?	O
L: No three over three so one, two, three like here.	B-A
F: There?	I-A
L: No the tire.	I-A
F: The tire? Oh okay.	I-A
L: Try that, I think that might (affect what we have).	I-A
F: Yeah I think we just need to make that distance longer. What? Okay.	B-ATV
L: Well…	B-NSTO
F: No.	B-OO
S: It's crashing.	B-NSTO
F: Alright lets fix that.	B-OO
L: Okay what do we need to switch?	B-ATO
S: Okay we need to make things that when it goes that way it's longer.	B-ATV
F: Yeah we need one of the distances to be longer.	I-ATV
S: Haba	B-OO
F: Sarah.	I-OO
L: Sarah.	I-OO
S: Sorry.	I-OO
F: Come on.	I-OO
S: Okay so what are we doing?	I-OO
F: Er	I-OO
L: So it goes forward, turns, forward, turns when, when does it go wrong?	B-ATO
F: I think it was that one. Wait, does this have a touch (screen)	I-ATO
L: Turn.	I-ATO
F: …what it's a touch screen, what.	B-OO
T: Ha ha ha ha	O
L: What?	B-OO
F: What kind of future, but it has a keyboard.	I-OO
S: What is it?	I-OO
F: It's just one of the new windows computers that okay, this is more tedious.	I-OO
L: Yeah so it goes forward and then turn whoa, whoa and then it goes forward again, turns.	B-ATO
T: What happened to your map? You have a map of two?	O
L: Okay and again make it…	B-ATV
S: Yeah, two maps.	B-OO
L: …one point (?).	B-ATV
T: (?) looking at.	O
S: Well they have so.	B-OO
F: Did you change the distance of that of one of the (?).	B-ATV
L: (?) they go like this, like this, they go like this…;	B-ATO
F: Alright lets just try it now, that’s fine.	B-OO
S: …(?).	I-OO
F: I’ll stay here and I can make changes.	I-OO
S: But (?) variation it can go like this, touch the back wall (?) go right there and go back and forward.	B-ATO
L: (?) that was incorrect.	B-NSTO
F: That one needs to be longer.	B-ATV
L: Yeah I think so. Okay. Okay.	B-OO
F: It will be sad if (?) the people who have the cheering sound fail the challenge they’ll be wo::::h huh huh huh  huh	I-OO
T: Be like upside down.	O
<laughs>	O
F: You tried.	B-OO
S: (?) What?	I-OO
T: (?) robot makes the cheering sound, you like that (?) upside down (?).	O
L: Oh my gosh. Okay um, this second, okay so…	B-ATO
F: This one?	I-ATO
L: No way. This has to be shorter.	B-ATV
F: This one?	B-ATO
L: Yeah.	B-OO
F: The turn, oh no…	B-ATO
L: Oh no the distance…	B-ATV
F: One, is that one point two five now, how much shorter does it need to be?	I-ATV
L: How about one Sarah?	I-ATV
F: Alright, well I need to download it to that before, before it works, as long as it's wireless, why can’t these future computers be wireless.	B-QR
<General classroom noise>	O
F: Okay I think it downloaded, wait.	B-QR
L: Got it?	B-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
S: (?) Internet Explorer, whatever that is.	I-OO
L: Fiona I think that you switched the wrong one.	B-ATV
F: Oh which one was it? Okay, which one did I switch? I switched…	I-ATV
L: That needs to be longer.	I-ATV
L: Okay and this one should be shorter.	I-ATV
F: So this one should be one point two five again?	I-ATV
L: Yeah.	B-OO
F: This one?	B-ATO
L: No it should be should be shorter so like two. I don’t know if we’re actually going to get it to work like, have something that works by the end.	B-ATV
F: We’re ahead of some of the other teams, in terms of how well it works.	B-OO
S: I wanna get this kit.	I-OO
F: Yeah it's gonna be so cool to do it. Yeah, the only one who have to work with other people.	I-OO
S: You could use your (own) table for the air hockey.	I-OO
T: (?) coke on it.	O
S: Well at least you got some points.	B-OO
L: Okay Sarah can you come here?	I-OO
S: What are we doing?	I-OO
L: Okay so when it goes… Can you just tell me, count for me how many turns this is. Okay so.	B-ATO
S: Okay.	B-OO
L: It goes…	I-OO
S: One, two, three…	B-A
L: No that’s two right.	I-A
F: One turn, two turns…	I-A
S: Three turns, four turns.	I-A
L: Okay on this, Fiona after the third turn it has to go forward… the	B-ATO
F: Go forward (?) more.	B-ATV
L: Yeah like two.	I-ATV
F: Okay.	B-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
F: Alright do you wanna plug it in? Here you go, turn it around so it can	I-OO
F: Hmm, hmm. What you eating?	I-OO
S: What?	I-OO
F: Oh I thought you were eating something, (?).	I-OO
S: You'd like me to eat something, no I'm not eating anything, why did you think I was eating? Fiona.	I-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO

T: Have you ever watched Star Trek?	O
S: I don’t think so, but I have seen Farscape.	B-OO
L: Are you sending it back to the same place?	B-A
T: How was that?	O
S: I was liking it, I didn’t get all the way through it though.	B-OO
L: Needs to be a bit longer.	B-ATV
F: Yes Sarah know where, okay Sarah.	B-OO
S: Okay good.	I-OO
F: Did you catch (?) one that I changed to two last time, so, this one right. No. Control Z does that work okay.	B-ATV
L: Oh thank god that was (frightening).	B-OO
F: Alright, two and a half?	B-ATV
L: Okay.	B-OO
F: I think it's that one.	B-ATO
S: Okay to run it?	B-OO
L: Yeah	I-OO
F: Er	I-OO
S: Just a tiny bit more.	B-ATV
F: A little further.	I-ATV
S: Yeah tiny bit more like maybe two point six or something.	I-ATV
F: Yeah that’s what I was…	B-OO
S: Or two point five, five.	B-ATV
F: Alright.	B-OO
F: Tiny bit more?	B-ATV
S: Ah.	B-NSTO
L: Yeah.	B-OO
S: Yeah.	I-OO
F: Two point seven?	B-ATV
L: Huh?	B-P
F: Two point seven.	B-ATV
L: You said that it doesn’t have to get back to base?	B-A
T: No in fact if you get it partly (?).	O
L: Oh okay.	B-OO
T: If you had time you could go for the second (fish).	O
L: Ah	B-OO
F: Sarah pick it up.	I-OO
S: Ow	B-NSTO
F: Okay.	B-OO
S: I'm, I'm in the middle of mourning (the) loss.	I-OO
L: I'm gonna try this again though.	I-OO
S: I think we need to find a way to tuck those wires in, de we still have rubber bands kicking around?	B-D
F: What happens if you hit a fish?	B-A
L: Yeah.	B-OO
F: What do the fishes do?	B-A
T: Nothing, they’re just (?).	O
L: Okay.	B-OO
T: But it’s not like they take points off or anything	O
S: Come on, come on, come on, live, do it for us, yes, noooo.	B-NSTO
L: Alright.	I-NSTO
S: We were closer last time. They got a claw now?	I-NSTO
L: Yeah.	B-OO
S: Sweet.	I-OO
<General classroom noise>	O
S: It ain’t got enough bacteria down, come on fly free.	B-OO
L: No, okay (?).	B-NSTO
S: Just make sure you line it up right and then we’re good.	B-A
L: Nope	B-NSTO

DBF: It worked so well.	O
G: Are you sure? Yeah because we accidentally broke it and then we had to fix it.	B-OO
DBA: No it was...	O
DBF: It was covering (?).	O
G: Yeah.	B-OO
K: I'm tired.	I-OO
G: I'm making it better, oh it's trying to.	I-OO
DBF: Oh didn’t do it again. Oh okay	O
DBA: Start it (?).	O
A: Where did you go.	B-OO
DBF: Lets start it here. That works.	O
DBA: Yay, okay one more time. Sorry. This will be our last.	O
DBF: (?) mistake (just so we know it’s)	O
G: Most likely	B-OO
DBS: All the tops are falling off (?). Ow this is rubbing off on you Fiona Cant we (?) a map at the back of my evil genius list.	O
G: Well I’ve got. Diamonds rubies etcetera (?)	B-OO
K: (?) supreme book of evil (?) his home town, brownie nights (?).	I-OO
G: Running like that he goes.	I-OO
A: It does wheelies.	I-OO
DBA: Okay you guys (?).	O
G: These are better.	B-OO
A: You go right there...	B-A
G: Let’s see if this works.	B-OO
A: Click it. Please just work already. Oh my god, no, no.	B-NSTO
T: That was different	O
A: Okay then.	B-OO
K: Okay so... back	I-OO
A: We need...(?)	I-OO
G: Horrible.	I-OO
K: Yeah okay.	I-OO
A: Bring it down to forty.	B-ATV
?: Better than, ours not.	O
A: No a little bit more, more, like thirty seven (?).	B-ATV
G: We need to give up on our original plan to just have it, to get the blue and the yellow thing.	B-A
A: The (purple) (circle) whatever.	B-OO
G: You guys an use this table.	I-OO
A: Okay, do forty.	B-ATV
K: Forty.	I-ATV
A: Or thirty nine.	I-ATV
G: Get rid of my turn right, turn left thing it didn’t work.	B-ATO
K: Forty and then...	B-ATV
A: It's downloading, hold on, download.	B-OO
K: Okay.	I-OO
A: Lets try that.	I-OO
K: After that, tell me how to go, how it went and then (?).	I-OO
G: Yours works really well.	I-OO
LBA: Not really. It's, that, that backing up is supposed to go there.	O
G: Well you got backing up and you have a forward you can come and get this one.	B-A
<classroom chatter>	O
G: Wow, that’s cool.  This one’s ours.	B-OO
LBS: Neat	O
A: Yeah flips up and down.	B-D
G: We didn’t use the sensor.	I-D
A: We just have eyes.	I-D
LBS: Oh I see. I like it	O
A: And like the eyes appear when we flip it down.	B-D
LBS: Cool.	O
A: Peek a boo.	B-OO
LBS: Okay we need to keep moving.	O
G: Okay let’s try this, lets bash this off.	B-OO
K: You’re on mission two?	I-OO
LBS: We have a couple of them and neither of them work.	O
K: No...oh gosh you (?).	B-OO
A: Could you just...	I-OO
K: Okay thirty seven?	B-ATV
A: No.	B-OO
K: Thirty five.	B-ATV
A: Thirty five.	I-ATV
G: I think if we were able to back it up and have it go around, it might work better.	B-A
T: (?).	O
G: Yeah because	B-OO
A: I wish it was remote like...	B-QR
T: Hey guys, guys I have an idea, I know but um...	O
K: Shall we delete this and try, try again one?	B-OO
G: I have an idea.	B-A
A: No just download it.	B-OO
K: Yeah touch just to see. And then...hey, Georgie, Georgie	I-OO
G: I have an idea find a way to get it to come around, instead of going and trying to harm the fish, find a way to have it go around.	B-A
K: Georgie I have a question.	B-OO
A: Too much.	B-DO
K: Guys, should, should I work on...oh (?). Should we do like a thirty?	B-ATV
G: When the pressure is applied...	B-A
K: Oh god what do we do?	B-OO
G: ...it pushes this back but then this goes (?).	B-A
A: Oh, no it's fine.	B-OO
T: Okay.	O
A: You can see it just moved over. Just gonna try.	B-A
K: Thirty.	B-ATV
G: Guys I think, Andi, Katie. I think we need to find a way to knock over the blue ball but instead of turning right we need to back it up and have it go around.	B-A
A: Okay lets...	B-OO
K: Why (?) waste extra time?	B-A
A: Yeah.  (Come) on let’s try it.	B-OO
G: But would you rather get all of these points.	B-A
A: Lets try this one and we’re gonna try thirty and if those two don’t work then we’re gonna start...	B-ATV
K: Okay I’m trying that. Guys, um okay.	B-OO
<classroom chatter>	O
DBS: It worked again.	O
<classroom chatter>	O
G: I know.	B-OO
A: Oh my t-shirt.	I-OO
A: Too much, too much of a turn, okay...	B-DO
G: Seven points.	B-OO
A: ...bump it down to twenty eight.	B-ATV
K: Okay this has messed up.	B-OO
G: If any bacteria.	B-A
A: Not it’s fine. Oh no what did you do?	B-OO
K: I didn’t do anything it just randomly (?)	I-OO
G: So we could knock over this and then we get seven points.	B-A
A: Hold on, let me see this computer.	B-OO
G: And then we, even though we wouldn’t have a ton of extra time it would be good.	B-A
A: There.	B-OO
K: It doesn’t want to cooperate.	I-OO
G: Guys it does seven points and we (?) if we did...the dispenser.	B-A
K: Should I do um, should I do another mission? Like while we’re working on this I can like focus on another one.	I-A
A: But we don’t even have one so all hands on deck. You should be...twenty seven.	B-ATV
K: Yeah lets try twenty seven.	I-ATV
A: And if this doesn’t work then we’re just gonna scratch this idea of. Eve (?)	B-OO
G: Guys I have an idea.	B-A
K: If it doesn’t work then...	I-A
G: You know what we could do?	I-A
A: Make a pole. I'm just saying.	I-A
G: Yeah make like a a claw of...if this one doesn’t work we could use this, have it out and then have it attached to the outside...	B-D
A: Hmm, hmm.	B-OO
G: So then when it goes over it can hit it.	B-D
K: Ah hah	B-OO
G: But then I’ll make a different one just in case that one doesn’t work.	B-D
A: Okay it just needs to go more forward, I found it.	B-ATO
G: What?	B-OO
A: Give me this thing, I got it.	I-OO
K: Okay.	I-OO
20:00 G: A::h	O
K: (I’m sorry) this is not working.	O
A: Just (?).	B-OO
G: But yeah if we.	I-OO
K: I just kind of wanna work on another mission, because I don’t want only have seven points.	I-OO
G: Yeah but we’ll have seven from that and then we’ll have the four from the ball, so that’ll be eleven and then if we can program it to go and get the yellow ball then we have fifteen.	B-A
K: Still there’s like three hundred and seventy eight (seventy six).	I-A
A: Well we’ll figure it out once we perfect this, because this is a big part.	B-OO
G: I'm gonna work on making the um...arm.	B-D
K: Okay you can work on that.	B-OO
A: Do you know you can make this a tablet by flipping it?	I-OO
K: Really?	I-OO
A: Yeah.	I-OO
K: Can we do that?	I-OO
A: Yeah I guess.	I-OO
A: Okay it doesn’t work, it doesn’t work. Just make it flat.	I-OO
G: This is just a touch screen computer.	I-OO
A: Boom, boom, so...and the test I last saw this was here.	B-A
DBF: Yeah. But that was for another setting we had. I think, lets try it from there, I think it was supposed to be this one was supposed to be. (?) it was over and over the ring.	O
K: I'm fixing something up is that okay?	B-OO
A: Well what are you fixing?	I-OO
K: Well right here this thing was supposed, it was out, was not there so like it would like boom boom, like boom, boom. And that might destroy the thing.	B-ATO
A: Make that thirty.	B-ATV
K: Thirty okay we got a thirty.	I-ATV
K: I need Eve.	B-OO
A: Why are you going backwards, no that’s not what you do. I found the issue.	B-DO
K: Okay what’s the issue?	B-OO
A: Okay, let me see the laptop. I found it. Here, this is easier for me.	I-OO
K: Yeah this is kind of easier.	I-OO
A: Erm...	I-OO
K: Here’s a flat surface. Kind of put it like that.  Oh yeah.	I-OO
A: You...so it goes back...	I-OO
K: Here let me help you with the arm.	B-D
A: This...where’s the...can you (plug this in?).	B-OO
K: Plugged in. Is that it?	I-OO
A: Yeah.	I-OO
K: Here it is. Okay, so...	I-OO
A: Ohhhh, why? Give me the...	B-NSTO
K: Take it, wait I got to test this for a sec.	B-OO
A: Go ahead	I-OO
G: What are you doing.	I-OO
K: Can we test this?	I-OO
A: Why’s my phone vibrating? Oh. You’re not supposed to do anything. You are supposed to be...that...	I-OO
K: Change your mind <singing>.	I-OO
A: Give me the robot, I think I found it.	I-OO
K: Her names Eve Andi.	I-OO
A: It's a robot.	I-OO
K: You’re so mean. Why would a robot that doesn’t have a name try to do world domination? It’s true.	I-OO
<general classroom noise>	O
A: Okay, now turn, turn, ohhh... Hold on. Oh goes forward... Give me the thing, I figured out why. We’re not even looking at it.  We’re not even looking at what’s the issue. We’re not even at it see?	B-DO
K: Okay.	B-OO
A: We’re trying to figure it out when it's all the way over here.	B-DO
K: Okay. Oh my gosh I need more coffee	B-OO
A: This...	I-OO
K: I'm gonna go and get some more coffee is that okay? No.	I-OO
A: Just wait a little.	I-OO
K: Hey I'm, I'm gonna clean our table. Oop’s sorry about that Andi.	I-OO
A: Okay	I-OO
K: Are you working on the arm?	B-D
G: Yeah.	B-OO
K: You do that...where’s (?). I need to cool down a bit.	I-OO
A: Give me a minute and I’ll join you.	I-OO
<general classroom noise>	O
A: (This don’t work.) I hope this works, but if it doesn’t, I don’t know.	B-OO
K: Okay.	I-OO
A: Eve this is one of your moments of truth.	I-OO
K: Please do this.	I-OO
A: Eve if you don’t do this I don’t know what we’re gonna do.	I-OO
K: Please be nice to us for once (?).	I-OO
A: I’m so tired.  Come on Eve...There you go Eve.	B-NSTO
T: That’s so close.	B-OO
A: Come on Eve, now you gotta just go back...I can fix that air bubble. It’s waiting.	B-NSTO
K: Oh I'm sorry about that. God.	B-OO
G: Hey I made the arm.	B-A
K: I’m going to die.	B-OO
A: Okay well we have a little bit of a programming bug...no not a bug.	I-OO
G: No all we need to do...	I-OO
K: You can see why this takes people three months to accomplish.	I-OO
G: What do you think?	I-OO
A: How do you make it so it does it for a longer time?	B-ATV
K: Speed? No not speed.	I-ATV
G: I have an idea, just have it go forward to get the ball and the we can attach the arm so then we don’t have to add anything else to the program. And make it less complicated and less time.	B-A
A: That means I have to re-do this.	B-OO
G: No, this is our new one.	B-A
A: Oh...oh.	B-OO
K: I have an idea.	B-A
G: So n- you two go take coffee break.	B-OO
K: I have a really good idea.	B-A
G: You two go take a coffee break.	B-OO
A: Where’s my phone?	I-OO
G: I don’t know you just had it.	I-OO
A: Oh there it is.	I-OO
K: I have a really good idea but...	B-A
A: Coffee Break?	B-OO
K: Yeah we’ll talk it over with coffee break, start thinking.	I-OO
30:00  <general classroom noise>	O
A: There’s no more coffee.	B-OO
K: Why? Water. Sure. And cheerios. Water and Oreo.	I-OO
A: I just want oreo okay.	I-OO
<general classroom chatter>	O
A: What’s that?	B-OO
K: Okay, so I have a really good idea that probably (?) not work,	B-A
A: We have to restart.	B-OO
K: What if I kind of like the stress? Okay (?) (Sure won’t get it alone)	I-OO
<general chatter>	O
K: Oh it doesn’t work? If it doesn’t work it doesn’t work. We have to try again. So anyways I have a really good idea that. That’s just the (sketch). We don’t really need that. What? God (?)it on.	B-A
?: No they’ll just bring other people back it obviously  affects your (?).	O

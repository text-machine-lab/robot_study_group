G: They’re all in our kits.	B-OO
DBS: Yeah but...	O
DBF: Yeah but we’re not using them Sarah so (?).	O
<classroom chatter>	O
A: What is she doing?	B-NSTO
T: (If it) knocks them out little by little.	O
A: Oh my god Eve, Eve, Eve.	B-NSTO
<laughing>	O
G: Fail, fail, we failed again.	B-NSTO
A: Hold on let me see, I got it. So	B-OO
K: What’s the problem here, where is the problem?	B-A
A: Everywhere, nothing is angling right.	I-A
K: Maybe we should not do it on an angle?	I-A
A: We’re not having an angle, hold on.  So forward... I got it.	I-A
G: (?).	O
A: Forward, that’s fine.	B-ATO
K: What are we doing backwards, forwards, backwards, forwards, backwards...	I-ATO
A: Yeah, this...(there’s forward) though.	I-ATO
K: Needs to be at...this other angle. Okay so back, forward...	I-ATO
M: You wanna hear this (?) it's time for a snack break, so there is one cookie per person until everybody has had one and then there, (?) go through the line again. We set up on the table out there and we take a little five minute break, have a snack then go back through, don’t forget to give your microphones (?) bathroom, okay?	O
K: So (?).	B-OO
G: Andi guess what happened?	I-OO
A: What?	I-OO
G: I angled it, it managed to knock two of these out...	B-DO
A: Huh, uh.	B-OO
G: But then it also came back to the base.	B-DO
K: Oh okay,	B-OO
G: So we’ll figure something out.	I-OO
K: So okay Georgie okay, Andi, can I call you Andi?	I-OO
A: Close enough yeah.	I-OO
K: (?) go right and knock this out, out of the way possibly get that back over here (?). I think I have a plan.	B-A
G: Okay.	B-OO
A: Oh my god you’re so focused in this and you’re not even like okay, aha okay, sure.	I-OO
G: I feel like I need a ton of sugar	I-OO
T: Yeah	O
G: And then go and run (?) for a few minutes.	B-OO
R: Hi everybody.	O
K: Oh can we get an oreo?	B-OO
R: (?) get back on the other side of the line, because there is a line going there.	O
K: Okay, I, I have to go program more. Yeah. I’ll be right back.	O
M: Yeah just make sure there’s enough for everybody, take one cookie	O
A: Are you? Is Georgie taking a break?	B-OO
K: Um she’s taking, here...	I-OO
A: Okay, (?)	I-OO
K: (?)	I-OO
A: Let’s try (?) this.	B-A
K: (?) try to see and maybe, maybe it might work if it doesn’t I have an idea.	I-A
A: I think it just needs tweaking, because this is just like a rough estimate currently.	I-A
K: Okay Okay.  After this (?) we can go get some cookies, (Second one)	B-OO
?: (Just a cut).	O
A: No. I’m good working.	B-OO
K: Ooh look at this.	I-OO
A: That one, that one doesn’t work on our robot.	I-OO
K: Is that how you like separate it?	I-OO
A: Um can I...	I-OO
<classroom chatter>	O
G: No, it just slides off.	B-D
?: No, what is...	O
G: Nothing, just to hold the case together.	B-D
?: Cool.	O
G: So how is you guys coming along?	B-OO
K: Right there	I-OO
? : Very badly.	O
G: Same here.	B-OO
A: Right there, she’s there.	I-OO
K: Ready?	O
A: Back up, up, up one more.	B-DO
?: Yeah me and her (?).	O
A: Oops that’s the wrong one.	B-OO
K: Which one, which one is it?	I-OO
WT: Are you gonna keep programming?	O
K: Yeah we’ll probably get one (done) later.	B-OO
A: Which way are they going? She’s already there.	B-NSTO
K: Program.	B-OO
A: Oh...	I-OO
G: My group already too their coffee break.	I-OO
A: Wait, wait, wait, there she goes, there...so close.	B-NSTO
G: And water	B-OO
A: Okay, okay, okay we can do this.	I-OO
K: Do you want me to go and get you a cookie?	I-OO
A: No.	I-OO
K: You sure?	I-OO
A: Yeah I’m good.	I-OO
K: I’ll be right back.	I-OO
A: I am perfectly fine working. So...	I-OO
?: (?) from Georgie’s (?). They let her do all the work.	O
?: (?) smarter (?)	O
?: (?) yeah you are.	O
?: (just because she’s smarter than you you shouldn’t) take advantage of it.	O
K: Okay. Andi is really good at it,	B-OO
G: What?	I-OO
K: She made a program up that can both knock out the bacteria, get the ball out of the way, um turn around a bit without destructing anything and get the yellow one.	B-A
G: It worked twice.	B-OO
K: And she, it was really close, it didn’t break anything, it didn’t (?).	B-A
G: Did it get back to the base?	I-A
K: Yeah it did get back to the base.	I-A
G: Well. Oh no my rubber band.	B-OO
?: Your mum doesn’t look like you.	O
K: A lot of people do, say that I do.	B-OO
?: It’s just your faces for some reason.	O
K: If you say.	B-OO
?: Like your faces don’t look like (?)	O
G: Everyone’s like oh my gosh you and your sister look so much alike, I look at her, I look at me in the mirror and I'm like no we don’t.	B-OO
?: No.	O
A: No I’m good.	B-OO
G: She has curly hair, I don’t, she’s like the same height as me but she likes to wear purple and like dresses.	I-OO
?: I want another muffin.	O
K: Me too.	B-OO
G: I (?) good anymore. I'm gonna go and get another cookie. Are we allowed to get another cookie?	I-OO
K: I got to finish programming.	I-OO
T: Everyone’s been through once, so, I was going to grab a second cookie.	O
G: Oh sorry.	B-OO
G: Don’t die. I'm sorry.	I-OO
K: I'm feeling really bad that Sally cant come?	I-OO
G: What happened do you know?	I-OO
K: Well all I know is that she has a lot of doctor appointments.	I-OO
G: What happened to Sally?	I-OO
?: Sally I know she hasn’t been here forever.	O
K: All I know is that she has a lot of doctors appointments. (?) something.	B-OO
?: What if she did, that would just be bad, oh my goodness.	O
K: If she what?	B-OO
?: Had ebola Sally.	O
?: (?)	O
?: You do, she does?	O
?: No. She, she drank the Ebola I reckon so, cos she had to go to a doctor appointment, and when you have to go to a doctor appointment you have to drink ebola.	O
G: Why?	B-OO
K: I don’t know it's just every team has to drink Ebola. I am not getting, I am not getting a doctor’s appointment.	I-OO
?: I have a doctor’s appointment on Tuesday.	O
G: How old are you?	B-OO
?: Twelve.	O
G: Then you can’t have it because you’re not thirteen yet.	B-OO
K: That’s so stupid they try and prevent ebola and they’re just giving you ebola.	I-OO
?: You’re just like.	O
K: I'm done with doctors.	B-OO
G: I have a doctors appointment on the twentieth	I-OO
?: How old are you?	O
G: Thirteen.	B-OO
?: They give it to (?).	O
K: Did you get it?	B-OO
?: No my mum, my mum was gonna take us.	O
A: No. I fixed some things	B-OO
G: It's not exactly a doctor’s appointment I'm getting a camera stuck up my nose and down my throat to see if I have vocal chord (?).	I-OO
K: It doesn’t really exactly need that much (turns).	B-ATO
A: Um well the goal wasn’t that, that wasn’t the goal. (?)	B-A
Okay.	B-OO
G: I am freaking out.	I-OO
?: I would not be able to do that.	O
A: Need to die.	B-OO
K: Do we n-...	I-OO
A: We need to go right	B-ATO
K: What do you mean?	B-OO
<classroom chatter>	O
A: Let’s try that	B-OO
K: Let’s try (really) want to get this	I-OO
A: She’s all set. (?)	I-OO
K: Oh yeah, can you fix the fish too?	B-A
A: It does not feel like Saturday.	B-OO
K: No. Only because	I-OO
A: Go ahead. Turn, turn, keep going, no keep going.	B-DO
K: Why is it not going?	I-DO
A: I will fix that.	B-OO
K: Let’s restart that, let’s restart that.	I-OO
A: No it's a faulty thing over here. I see. You should have power, you shouldn’t be at zero you should have sixty...it's just a lot of computer work really.	B-ATO
G: What’s your robot’s name? Our’s is Eve for Evil.	B-OO
K: Did you get it?	I-OO
A: Yeah.	I-OO
K: Okay lets try this.	I-OO
A: Darn it, I have to be over here hold on. Okay she’s all set. There, there, there, oh my god we were so close. What are you doing now? What are you doing?	B-NSTO
G: You may, you may have done a right turn instead of a left one.	B-ATO
A: Yeah that’s, I think...that one’s supposed to go. This top thing is really confusing. Okay I think we can get rid of this one.	B-QS
G: Why?	B-OO
A: Because it already has a backwards one right here.	B-ATO
G: Okay, whatever.	B-OO
G: Oh no.	I-OO
A: There you go.	I-OO
G: Okay let’s download it	I-OO
A: Program.	I-OO
K: It’s like plug her in.	I-OO
A: Oh I need that.	I-OO
K: She’s all set.	I-OO
A: Wait, doesn’t look right, there’s one too many here I think.	B-ATO
G: Yeah.	B-OO
A: No it's fine, except I don’t know why this says seventy six forward.	B-ATV
G: No that's not seventy six forward that’s just seventy six (?) like the speed.	I-ATV
A: Yeah I know.	B-OO
K: Come on, can somebody download it. It's downloading.	B-QR
A: Try ha-	B-OO
K: I got this, I got this,	I-OO
A: I'm gonna go  use the bathroom okay.	I-OO
G: Okay.	I-OO
K: Okay.	I-OO
G: Don’t forget to turn your mic off.	I-OO
A: Yeah.	I-OO
G: Only with that one (?).	I-OO
A: I'm just gonna leave it here.	I-OO
G: Katie come and use this one.	I-OO
K: Okay.	I-OO
G: Oh nice job, nice job. Nice job.	I-OO
DBA: Wait Fiona where were we at?	O
DBS: We’re about like right here.	O
G: How come, where’s the beach? I wanna go sunbathing. There’s no beach here it's just dirt, there’s no beach I wanna go sunbathing.	B-OO
K: Oh look.	I-OO
G: That’s works beautifully.	I-OO
K: Um can you... Okay ready?	I-OO
G: Yeah, go.	I-OO
DBF: We’re not gonna move a robot we just want to look at where it was lined up a little bit, oh.	O
K: What are you doing? Why are you not going backwards? Okay there we are.	B-DO
G: ((singing))	B-OO
K: No it killed a baby fish.	B-A
G: It's watching it.	B-OO
K: Wait.	I-OO
DBF: You’re just watching it murder the fish.	O
K: Okay we got a (?) we did wrong here.	B-DO
G: I got it	B-OO
K: No I, I, I wanna program. So, so forward, backward, okay wait, wait, wait, we we gotta use the map (?) backwards. Forward um backwards.	B-ATO
G: What?	B-OO
K: Do, do, no do, do	I-OO
G: There, lets try that.	I-OO
K: Yeah lets try that.	I-OO
K: Let’s go,	I-OO
G: Let’s go test it, let’s go test it, let’s go test it. Why is there a baby fish all alone, where’s the mom?	I-OO
K: The mum is...	I-OO
G: No.	I-OO
K: ...that’s the mom, dad and aunt.	I-OO
G: This can’t be the mum it's blue and red not red and yellow.	I-OO
K: It's red, this is the only red one here, so that must be the mum.	I-OO
G: It ca-	I-OO
K: The dad has a yellowish thing so...this is the dad, this is the mom and that’s the uncle.	I-OO
G: Hey baby fish I'm over here, it's beautiful over here. It most certainly is.	I-OO
DBS: Where are you going?	O
DBF: What are you doing?	O
<laughing>	O
A: How’s it running now?	B-OO
G: We don’t know yet.	I-OO
K: We, we don’t know yet.	I-OO
A: Okay, okay just thought I’d go.	I-OO
K: Let it go, let it go, can’t hold it back <singing>.	I-OO
G: Okay that’s good. Ready, on your marks, get set,	I-OO
K: Okay I'm, I'm putting in position.	B-A
G: Oh your marks.	I-A
A: It goes right there.	I-A
G: On your mark, get set...	B-OO
A: Just click it.	I-OO
K: What are you doing?	I-OO
A: Yes	I-OO
K: Er wait why, why, why don’t we go and try again? Yeah.	I-OO
A: Okay, turn, turn, turn yeah, yes, yes, grrrrr.  You are so...	B-DO
K: I spread ebola.	B-OO
G: Okay.	I-OO
A: So,	I-OO
G: This one needs to turn more, maybe it should be a right turn and a left turn.	B-ATO
A: It's kind of complicated. Here let me just try putting more power,	B-ATV
10:00 G: I think it needs to be a right turn then a left turn.	B-ATO
A: You can go at seventy two.	B-ATV
K: Let it go let it go ((singing))	B-OO
A: Let me just try this.	I-OO
G: I think it needs, instead of this, this needs to be a right turn.	B-ATO
A: Hold on let me download this first.	B-OO
K: Okay guys so here’s what we wanna do basically.	I-OO
A: We’re already downloading.	I-OO
K: Okay, okay. Well this is basically a plan, go forward, a bit backward and then take the bacteria out, go backwards.	B-ATO
A: Let me download it.	B-OO
K: To the base (?). Backward and then go (?).	B-ATO
A: Yeah download	B-OO
K: I think I know what we’re doing?	I-OO
A: This is touch screen.	I-OO
K: Why’s it not downloading?	I-OO
G: Because you haven’t touched download yet.	I-OO
K: Oh, I really like these (?)	I-OO
RT: How’s it going? What you working on now?	O
G: We’re trying to perfect our design.	B-OO
RT: Awesome	O
A: We’ve got like the basic program and we just (?).	B-OO
RT: Just refining it?	O
A: Yeah.	B-OO
RT: Fantastic.	O
K: Okay lets go try it.	B-OO
DBA: Well it comes back correctly.	O
DBF: Yeah but it doesn’t do anything, okay.	O
DBA: That’s a good sign.	O
RT: Moving this in about seven inches. Yeah.	O
DBF: Alright.	O
RT: Let’s do, lets do the whole thing like two more inches that way, great perfect.	O
DBS: Let them try it.	O
RT: No wait, lets, lets (?) it must have been a tilt in the table.	O
DBA: Okay, go ahead.	O
A: It kind of feels, okay Ge- Georgie you are not two.	B-OO
G: Yes I am.	I-OO
<laughing> <screaming>	O
DBA: Lets try it again.	O
DBA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.	O
DBT: Victory.	O
DBF: It worked.	O
G: That was awesome, good job.	B-OO
